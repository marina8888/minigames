# the function play takes in a board which looks like the following array:

# board = [[" ", " ", " "],
#          [" ", " ", " "],
#          [" ", " ", " "]]

#it must return a tuple, where (1,1) will play to the centre spot.
# use board variable to check conditions and decide where to play.
#take into account that you will loose if you play in a spot that someone else has already played in!
#once finished, add "from players import [your name]" to the top of the main file and substitute [yourname].play(board)
#into the referee function found in main. Enjoy the game and good luck!

def play(board):
    # insert some game deciding logic here
    pass
    return ('y_axis value','x_axis value') # any tuple such as (0,1), (2,2) etc.
